I have been teaching this course at Johns Hopkins University SAIS for the past four semesters to 15-20 students. The aim of the course is to prepare graduate students for the practical uses of statistical software in an entry-level research position; namely, cleaning and wrangling data, rather than complex econometric analyses. As a six-hour course, the aim is to provide the students with the knowledge of what is possible with R and where they can find additional information as they continue to develop their skills.
